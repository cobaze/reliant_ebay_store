<h5>Step 1:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspReceiving with quality check</h5>

<h5>Step 2:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInstallation</h5>

</li>

<li>
<h5>Step 3:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPower-up sequence and monitor</h5>
You, our customer, deserves a flawless experience. The Power-Up and Monitor phase tells us what hidden issues may exist that need correction or possibly to remove the equipment from sellable inventory. We monitor the equipment during this phase to look for hidden issues.
