			<ul class="pp_page">
				<li>
				<h5>Step 1:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspReceiving with quality check</h5>
				Upon arrival we inspect all inbound equipment to make sure it is packed properly, and is in good physical condition, updating records of any missing components or breakage.  Damaged equipment is discarded.
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<h5>Step 2:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInstallation</h5>
				There is a right way and wrong way to do things. By following manufacturer documentation to install the equipment, we take the first step to ensure you get the results you expect from your order.
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<h5>Step 3:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPower-up sequence and monitor</h5>
				You, our customer, deserves a flawless experience. The Power-Up and Monitor phase tells us what hidden issues may exist that need correction or possibly to remove the equipment from sellable inventory. We monitor the equipment during this phase to look for hidden issues.
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<h5>Step 4:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspQuality Testing</h5>
				Burn-in and Run-Time will tell us if this equipment has passed our quality standards, ensuring our team can count on the equipment to deliver results.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul class="pp_page_two">
				<li>
				<h5>Step 5:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspData Sanitization</h5>
				We value your privacy and regulatory requirements. In order to further develop a high level of trust and teamwork, we run all of our used data storage equipment through a documented sanitization process to make sure all equipment is wiped and sanitized.
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<h5>Step 6:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspQuality Assessment</h5>
				We review log file analysis of configuration, software versions, errors and other deep technical stuff to make sure the equipment works and is ready to perform and exceed expectations.
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<h5>Step 7:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPacking</h5>
				You deserve to be able to install your equipment the moment it arrives, freeing up your team to do mission-critical work vs. chase down missing components. We make sure we include all the proper components to ensure a top-notch experience.
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<h5>Step 8:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFinal Quality Review</h5>
				Review output for Reliant Rock-Solid Certification is the final stamp of approval guaranteeing a positive customer experience. Our operations ‘A Team’ is charged with making sure you can count on your order.
