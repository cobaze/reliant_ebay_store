	<h2 class="our_comps">Company Culture - Core Values</h2>
	
	<img src="http://www.reliant-technology.com/media/wysiwyg/Images/Reliant_Culture.jpg" alt="Reliant As A Company" class="company_pic" />
	
	<p class="our_comp_two">Our core values are the foundation of our company and demonstrate what is really important to us as an organization. These three core values represent our business, our people, and our strategy. They are our promise to our customers and employees that we vow to live out each and every day.</p>
	
	<h5>Teamwork:</h5>
	<p class="our_comp_two">Whether it's a team event or working together to solve a problem, we believe teamwork is our most important core value. An old African Proverb states, “If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” We believe that by sharing our experiences, resources, and momentum, the group achieves more together and that's key to building something great for our customers, partners, and team.</p>
	
	<h5>Change the Game:</h5>
	<p class="our_comp_two">Changing the game means we aren’t constrained by the status quo and that we are willing to go the extra mile to find the right solution for our customers. Whether that means architecting a storage solution to solve a performance issue or launching a new product that can help our customers learn from one another, we’ll constantly be pushing ourselves to take our game to the next level.</p>
	
	<h5>Have Fun and Get It Done:</h5>
	<p class="our_comp_two">“Have Fun and Get It Done” means that results and relationships are two equal and important priorities. We value energetic attitudes and a work-hard, play-hard mentality. Our team is proactive, motivated, and loves to laugh. At Reliant, we realize it's all about balance, humor, results, and enjoying our work and each other.</p>
